              <p className="mt-3 text-lg">
                  SSP is a smart pole based on the principle of IoT. The SSP can be used in many different fields like bank security, airport, agriculture fields, and some important buildings of the country.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-3 text-lg">
                  The SSP is mainly focusing on providing a cheaper, advanced, and high-security surveillance system for the locals.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-3 text-lg">
                  The SSP is controlled by an app called BSS Companion. Using this app, a user can control the SSP from any place and monitor it.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-3 text-lg">
                  The SSP is multifunctional, featuring a 360-degree camera for full coverage video capture. A solar panel provides electricity to all the sensors and cameras.
