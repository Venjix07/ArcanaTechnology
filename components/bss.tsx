                    BSS is a fence and a smart IoT device in the shape of a pole for security surveillance and many more purposes. The BSS is mainly focused on saving soldiers' lives at the border and aims to implement a cheap, strong, and smart security fence that can be used in borders and various other fields. The BSS is dedicated to the brave soldiers who are protecting our motherland from foreign attacks.

                    India shares its border with 7 other countries. The total length of the border of India is approximately 15,200 kilometers, with some areas being deserts and others in the Himalayas. Currently, the borders are secured by large walls with minimal smart security systems. We are introducing BSS (Border Security System), a smart IoT device with advanced security surveillance and high-tech sensors for smart monitoring.

                    The BSS consists of a pole and a metal fence. We have divided the poles into sectors, each equipped with 360-degree cameras. For electricity, solar panels are used, and the poles are connected with optic fiber cables. The system includes sensors such as GPS modules, temperature sensors, humidity sensors, and LIDAR for smart monitoring.

                    Our plan is to integrate this system into Indian borders for enhanced surveillance and security. By using this smart pole, we can track borders intelligently.
